        <li>Missing closing tag on paragraph element on line 74.</li>
        <li>"Em" element was missing "m" on opening tag and closing tag for line 80.</li>
        <li>Added the "html" body closing tag at the end of the page.</li>
        <li>I felt like the title shoudlv'e been bigger than the authors name so I switched the heading values on lines 31-32.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Was missing closing tag "/b" for bold element on line 26</li>
        <li>Changed broken link to a link to the Bay wikipedia page on line 40</li>
        <li>Changed "where do i go" to the Segmental Arch Wikipedia Page on line 56</li>
        <li>Changed Heading from "h6" to "h3" to match other headings in the page</li>
        <li>Changed "h2" to "h3" to match the rest of the headings. Also switched bold and h3's positions because "h3" cant be a child element to "b". Line 52.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Page 3</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The "i" was missing in the "li" element on line 52.</li>
        <li>Moved the names and ages into the right places for the table.</li>
        <li>I dont think this is supposed to be a heading. I changed it into a table description instead on line 79.</li>
        <li>Was missing the "d" in the "td" element on line 83.</li>
        <li>Changed the heading size from "h4" to "h3" because I felt like it didn't really match the article or show importance. Line 60.</li>
        <li>Added a superscript (sup) to [6] because thats usually how they are referenced in articles. Line 58</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Page 4</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Was missing the "!DOCTYPE" html Element in the beginning of the page.</li>
        <li>Reorganizing all the images to be in the right place for the table.</li>
        <li>The Orange Cat image was missing the "td" tags for the table on line 37.</li>
        <li>The Dog Sitting image was missing the closing "td" tag on line 42.</li>
        <li>The Creature Image was missing the opening "td" tag for the table on line 44.</li>
        <li>Added alt to all of the images in the table because the W3 validator had a problem with them not having alts. The alts help if the image doesn't load so the reader can still know what the image is.</li>
    </ul>
