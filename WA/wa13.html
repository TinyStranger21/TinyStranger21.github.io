<!--Idea: A page of 100 random positioned balls that each have a value associated with it. 
    When you click on the ball you will get the volume that was assigned on it. 
    The ball also deletes once you click on it so you only get it once.
    Or when you scroll down the page, the volume decreases too.
    I feel like I could do this using a position thing. 
    Like track the position of an invisible dot so I can track the position on the screen.
    I would also make a volume text that will float in the middle of the page and ->
    that will constantly udpate when the page moves up or down.

    Another idea adding onto the scroll would be to make a bunch of scroll boxes each doing something different.
    So one with multiply the number by a certain amount, one that adds a certain amount, one that just changes colors.
    I could have a ton of boxes that have random functions that I put into an array or that I made and put them into a specified random area.
    Only two boxes will be able to control the volume. And one box will have the volume displayed.
