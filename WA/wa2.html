        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Kai Gary Franks. I am a 5'11 male with dirty blond hair who was born and raised in Erie, Colorado.</p>
        <p>Since I was a little kid, I have always wanted to be an Engineer and create things. 
            Going out of highschool I really liked the idea of mechanical engineering but, as I became more interested in photoshop and other design I started to question that idea. 
            I then found CTD and ATLS and learned more about the things I could persue within the realm of design. So far UI/UX is in my peak interest which is why I am taking this course.</p>
        <p>My goal for this course is to learn as much as I can about web design and coding and be able to confidently design in the future.</p>
